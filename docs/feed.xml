  <title>Lahiru's dev journal</title>
  <subtitle>Hey, I'm Lahiru Pathirage. I've been professionally building software since 2016, working on everything from simple tools to complex enterprise systems. One thing thatâ€™s always held true for me is that good design leads to great software. I'm deeply focused on AI agents and serverless architecture; building systems that are intelligent, scalable, and require minimal human intervention. I'm a computer science graduate who feels at home in a terminal, loves Linux, and believes open source makes everything better.</subtitle>

      Hereâ€™s something that bugs me: AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever AI youâ€™re using are great at cranking out code fast,
but they often generate REST APIs that look like they were designed by someone who never had to maintain them.

Over the past few years working with different teams, Iâ€™ve noticed that about most of AI-generated APIs have naming conventions that make me question ...

Why Arch Linux? Letâ€™s Jump In!

Hey there, fellow developer community! If youâ€™ve been browsing Linux distributions, you know there are tons of options out there. Iâ€™ve tested a few, gone on some Linux adventures, and finally landed on Arch Linux. And, wow, itâ€™s been my go-to for over 11 years now. If you want a powerful development setup and want to learn Linux hands-on, Arch could be your gol...
