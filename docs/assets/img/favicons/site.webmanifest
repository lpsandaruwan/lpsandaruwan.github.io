  "description": "Hey, I'm Lahiru Pathirage. I've been professionally building software since 2016, working on everything from simple tools to complex enterprise systems. One thing thatâ€™s always held true for me is that good design leads to great software. I'm deeply focused on AI agents and serverless architecture; building systems that are intelligent, scalable, and require minimal human intervention. I'm a computer science graduate who feels at home in a terminal, loves Linux, and believes open source makes everything better.",
