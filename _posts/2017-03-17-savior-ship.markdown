Savior Ship is a simple 2D shooter game implemented using C++ and simple direct media layer version 2(SDL2),
This is the way I attempted to refresh my skills on C++. Savior ship has been released under GPL license in GitHub for the purpose
of helping out the people who seek SDL2 beginner level applications to learn.
