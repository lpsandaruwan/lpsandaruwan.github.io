[**KalaGola**](http://github.com/lpsandaruwan/kalagola) is a cross platform **Pythonic tool** to traverse through the timeline of your **GitHub hosted font** repository,
and **generate a video file** to show how your font evolved through time. Just provide your custom **web template** and
**repository information** as a **YAML file** or as **command line** arguments, KalaGola will serve you your video.
<br>
<br>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
KalaGola uses [**weasyprint**](http://weasyprint.org/) to **capture html snapshots** after checking out each and every commit made on a **specific
font file** and copying the font file on that state to the assets directory which html template uses. As soon as possible KalaGola finished capturing images,
using [**OpenCV**](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python) bindings for Python, KalaGola converts captured images to frames and then frames to a video file.
<br>
<br>

<h4>How can I use it?</h4>
Like mentioned above, KalaGola configurations can be given as a YAML file or as command line arguments. If no argument has been provided
KalaGola uses `config.yml` file by default.
<br>

**_Contents of config.yml file_**
{% highlight bash %}
name: myfont
assets_dir: template/assets
branch: gh-pages
font_file: fonts/AbhayaLibre-Regular.otf
index_file: template/index.html
interval: 100
repository: abhaya-libre-font
stylesheet: template/assets/stylesheet.css
user: mooniak
{% endhighlight %}

* `name` - For `name`, provide any name you like(**do not use spaces**), once KalaGola has finished, you will find **name.avi** video file in the **videos** directory from KalaGola  home.

* `assets_dir` - This is where you are going **put your font** while traversing commits. The font file copied to assets directory will be named as **myFont** and you should
use it in your stylesheet like this or in a better way,

{% highlight css %}
@font-face {
    font-family: "My Font";
    src: url('assets/myfont') format("woff");
}
{% endhighlight %}

* `index_file` - This is the template html file which contains the layout designs, **designed using your font file**,
 which is to be captured while changing the state of font file.

* `stylesheet` - The stylesheet can be embedded into **html file's header** or YAML file's `stylesheet` field.

* `repository` - This one stands for GitHub repository name.

* `user` - Consider puttting GitHub user name or organization here.

* `branch` - This is the branch of the repository which contains font files, which is affected by [**continuous integration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) process, where font files,
 ttf or otf files have been automatically built or updated, or simply have been built manually and pushed.

* `font_file` - This is the path to the font file in the `branch`, which KalaGola refers to load the templates and capture images.

* `interval` - This field is used to reduce the CPU utilization while KalaGola capturing snapshot, by default it is 100, which means for every 100 of captures,
  KalaGola sleeps for a second. For older PCs reduce the `interval` number so they won't get heat up.

 To get an idea about the project structure, please refer [Abhaya Libre Font](https://github.com/mooniak/abhaya-libre-font),
 which is mentioned in the default `config.yml` file of KalaGola.
<br>

**_Command line arguments_**<br>
Simply use command line arguments to **override default settings** in runtime. They are the same as the YAML config file's options.
Prefer `kalagola -h` for more information,

{% highlight bash %}
usage: kalagola.py [-h] [-a ADIR] [-b BRANCH] [-f FONT] [-i INDEX] [-n NAME]
                   [-r REPO] [-s STYLESHEET] [-t INTERVAL] [-u USER] [-y YAML]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ADIR, --adir ADIR  Directory to put font file dynamically
  -b BRANCH, --branch BRANCH
                        Branch containing font files
  -f FONT, --font FONT  Font file source
  -i INDEX, --index INDEX
                        Custom index html file
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Output file name
  -r REPO, --repo REPO  GitHub user repository
  -s STYLESHEET, --stylesheet STYLESHEET
                        Custom CSS style sheet
  -t INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        Refresh intervals to increase CPU usage
  -u USER, --user USER  GitHub username/organization name
  -y YAML, --yaml YAML  Read settings from yaml file
{% endhighlight %}
