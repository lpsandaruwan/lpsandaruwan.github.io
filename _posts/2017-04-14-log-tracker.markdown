Log Tracker is a simple wrapper around Python **paramiko** to track text files using SSH.
It gives you the ability to create custom python functions to track and analyze log files the way you want.
A user can access the contents in multiple log files at the same time also.
Using a custom function a user can display a log content in a web interface using Flask like lightweight web service,
so then anyone can analyze contents easily, without wasting time to login into servers and download contents.
